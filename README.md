# Localizations

To add your own localization, create a copy of `en.strings` with the language code as the filename, localize it and submit it with a pull request.

## History

These localizations are for [GateToFreedom](https://github.com/pixelomer/GateToFreedom), a setup tweak that was never released in binary form.
